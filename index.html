        Introduction: <br>
        My name is Hoan Tran and I am a graduate from the University of California, Irvine majoring in Computer Science. My interests in the field of Computer Science
        include AI/Machine Learning as well as Computer Vision.
        <br>
        These are some of the projects I have done so far that I felt were worth sharing. Many revolve around AI/Machine Learning concepts, but I also have experience with
        other types of projects such as some Full Stack Development and algorithm testing.

    <p class="summary">
        Summary: <br>
        Our group decided to try and create the Wumpus World AI within Minecraft using Microsoft's Project Malmo library. Using Malmo, we designed the
        Wumpus World game and its rules within Minecraft. We made it so that our agent would run on randomly generated worlds with different sizes as
        well as a varying number of pits. Each block of the map represents a different cell in the Wumpus World and type of block the agent stands on
        determines what it senses in the area. The agent will blindly traverse the map using a search algorithm so that it can backtrack once it finds
        an obstacle or a dead end. Towards the end of the project we started experimenting with different search algorithms starting with a DFS algorithm,
        then DFS with Djikstra's for the backtracking, A* without a heuristic, and A* with a heuristic. The heuristic used for A* was based on the number of
        nearby blocks that have been explored within a certain radius from a given block.

    <a class="summary" href="https://github.com/hd-tran/NBA_Regression_Predictions" target="_blank">NBA Game Predictions Repo</a>
    <p class="summary">
        Summary: <br>
        Our group wanted to try and predict a given matchup between two NBA teams that have been playing in the season. To do this, our group first chose
        the features of the games that wil be used to predict who would win. We decided to use the "Four Factors" as described by Dean Oliver to be our
        data. For each game we compiled the data as the team's Effective Field Goal Percentage, Turnover Percentage, Offensive Rebound Percentage, and
        Free Throw Percentage. These four attributes would then be plotted as a function of their opponents Defensive Rating calculated by Basketball
        Reference where we got our data from. We then split the data for each attribute into Testing and Training data to generate Polynomial Regression Lines
        and chose the degree with the least error using the Regression function to predict their "next" game using that opponent's average Defensive Rating for
        the season up to that point. We then use Dean Oliver's percentage breakdown to calculate a weighted value to see who's weighted value is higher and by
        how much. We chose a concluded season from 2010 to make sure our approach to the problem was plausible as a predicter.

    <p class="summary">
        Summary: <br>
        Our group decided to look into how machine learning and neural networks can help in the medical field. One of the most prominent use cases is image
        recognition and image processing for medical images. In this case we decided to use colonoscopy image and video data since we found a free data set to use
        as well as a data set provided by a professor and graduate student.
